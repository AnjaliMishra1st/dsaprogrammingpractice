# 🧠 DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice programs.  
It includes solutions to problems from **arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching**, and more.

## 📂 Folder Structure
```

DSA-Practice/

├── arrays/
├── linked_lists/
├── sorting/

├── templates/

├── problems_list.md
└── README.md

## 🧰 How I Work

1. Create a new folder for each topic (like `arrays`, `stacks`, etc.)
2. Copy the template file into that folder.
3. Rename it based on the problem (e.g., `two_sum.cpp`).
4. Add a short explanation and commit the solution.

## ⚙️ Languages Used
- C++
- Python *(planned)*
- Java *(optional in future)*

---

## 🗓️ Progress Tracker
You can check my daily progress and solved problems in [`problems_list.md`](./problems_list.md).

---

## ✨ Goal
Practice 1–2 problems daily and build strong DSA concepts with clean, commented code.
