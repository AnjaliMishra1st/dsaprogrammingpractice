At a university, two student clubs, "Tech Wizards" and "Creative Minds," have decided to merge and form a new club called "Innovative Thinkers." 
The program takes two arrays, arr1, and arr2, as inputs with sorted member IDs. Each array represents the member IDs of the respective clubs. Help Alex and Sarah.
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the size of the first array (Tech Wizards).
The second line of input consists of n space-separated integers, representing the member IDs of the first array.
The third line of input consists of an integer m, representing the size of the second array (Creative Minds).
The fourth line of input consists of m space-separated integers, representing the member IDs of the second array.
